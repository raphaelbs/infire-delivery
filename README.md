# InFire Delivery

This is built upon [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [TravisCI](http://travisci.org/).

It uses the Firebase Storage and Firestore to store information about items and display then dynamically.

The lighthouse performance score could be improved by moving the firebase read phase to the SSR thus requiring to pay for a server.

## Roadmap

- Add item page
- Add share button
- Add an admin page
